# SVD team

[Werner Rammer](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/edfm/team/dr-werner-rammer/) 
and [Rupert Seidl](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/edfm/team/prof-dr-rupert-seidl/), both from the [Ecosystem Dynamics group at the Technical University of Munich](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/en/edfm/start/) are the principal investigators of SVD. SVD development started at [BOKU Vienna](http://www.boku.ac.at). 

## SVD collaborators

In addition to the SVD core group at the Ecosystem Dynamics group at TUM, a growing number of collaborators plan to or 
actively work already with SVD. 

* [Ecosystem and Landscape ecology lab](https://turnerlab.ibio.wisc.edu/) (Monica Turner, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA). 
Goal of the collaboration is an upscaling of local modeling results to a larger scale (Greater Yellowstone National Park).
* [Forest Futures lab](http://forestfutureslab.org/) (Winslow Hansen, Cary Institute, USA). Goal is to apply the model for large scale simulations in Alaska. 


## SVD related projects

* [iLand](https://iland-model.org): iLand is a model of forest landscape dynamics, 
simulating individual tree competition, growth, mortality, and regeneration. 
It addresses interactions between climate (change), disturbance regimes, vegetation dynamics, and 
forest management. iLand was developed by the same core team as SVD, and data from iLand simulations
can be used within the SVD framework.

## Research projects

* [Resonate](https://resonateforest.org/) is a EU Horizon 2020 project. SVD is used for continental scale simulations with a particular focus on disturbance dynamics.
* [Future Forest](https://future-forest.eu/) is a research project funded by the German Federal Ministery for the Environment. SVD is used for country scale (Germany) simulations of various forest management scenarios for climate change adaptation.
